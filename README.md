# Fruits-and-Vegetable-Classification-Transfer-Learning-CNN

In this project we develop the streamlit App which is capable of predicting different categories of the Fruits and Vegetables.

In this project we used the different technique which is `Transfer Learning` in `CNN`.

In this technique we will have to use the pretrained model like `VGG16, VGG19, etc.` But in this we have used the `MOBILENETV2` to predict the category of the image.

## Modules used:
* tensorflow
    * keras->applications->`MobileNetV2`
    * layer->Dense
    * keras->Model
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* os
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## To Classify the images
run a following command in command prompt
```
streamlit run .\main.py
```
## Deployment
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Image Generator
5. Data Augmentation
6. Model(Neural Network) Building and Tuning
7. Building Flask API
8. Pushing code to Github
```
